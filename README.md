# Game
Create a class Game, which allows a user to play "Guess the Number" game once. Game should have the following methods: 
=>    Constructor to generate the random number.
=>    takeUserInput() to take a user input of number.
=>    isCorrectNumber() to detect whether the number entered by the user is true.
=>    getter and setter for noOfGuesses.
Use properties such as noOfGuesses(int), etc. to get this task done!
